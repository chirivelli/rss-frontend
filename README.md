# RSS Reader

## Usage

If you want to group together all of your daily reads in one place, you can do that with this App

- Find the RSS feed link for your blogs
- Add them to your subscriptions
- All articles will be fetched dynamically

## Installation and Running

We also need [RSS aggregator](https://github.com/chirivelli/rss-aggregator), another repo to act as backend

Run the Frontend Dev server:

```bash
  bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) from your browser to see the application.

Check out the Backend for this project

Run the Backend Dev server:

```bash
  bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) from your browser to see the application.

Now hopefully everything is wired up properly, add the rss feed links and enjoy all the blogs in one place!
